Static methods:

Static method defines a static method which is a utility function so that we can call it with Class and pass the objects as parameters so it performs a function. See example in point_class.js

this:

Inside all our instance methods and constructor the keyword 'this' refers to the object created from that class

Difference between array and linked list:

In array each element is represented by indices but in linked list we don't have an index instead each element is pointed to its next element like a bunch of cars that connects to next one and so on.

So to get to 5th element we can go there by one by one.  Linked lists consists of nodes and each nodes has a value and a pointer to another node or null. It contains a head , tail and a length property
